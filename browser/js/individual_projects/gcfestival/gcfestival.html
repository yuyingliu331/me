			<p>The Global Citizen Festival is an annual music festival that brings together global leaders and artists to make contributions towards ending extreme poverty.</p>

			<p>Tickets can be won by taking a series of actions and earning points.<p>

			<p> With the help of Global Citizen's in house graphic designer, I created this gameboard design. The gameboard was used to encourage users to take actions in a specified order.  It saw over 50,000 visitors daily in the three months leading up to the Festival.</p>

			<p> The page featured clickable actions with hover-over information for each one.  It worked across browsers, and was mobile friendly.</p>
